# Marketplace Schedule

<button>
## [8:30 - 10 AM : Psychedelic Screamwerk Journey](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/505711234917/)
</button>
**(Reservation only - SOLD OUT)**

Through this technique of active breathwork, we are able to quiet the loudness of the thinking mind so we can access emotions in the body.

The scream portion facilitates an energetic release- a letting go of emotions that are holding us back from moving forward, and it feels so good to energetically let it out.

An intentional scream is also proven to trigger endorphins in the brain to create a natural high- yes please!

Led by the Founder of Screamwerk™️, Candice Wells of @the_spiritual_experience and her team of Trauma-Informed Facilitators.

Ready to let that shit go? Join us for this transformative session.

## [10:30 - 12 PM : Know Your Rights w/ Professor Ian](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/505696039467/)
</button>
This session will address two topics. First, the session will involve a discussion of the constitutional rights that individuals have when investigated by, or confronted by, law enforcement. The main focus of this discussion will be the limits on the powers of law enforcement contained in the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution: when police are allowed to search or detain individuals, when they have to read you your rights, what you should do or say (and even more importantly, not do or say) to effectively invoke your rights, and when you are allowed to video record law enforcement officers. The session will include the ways in which law enforcement are trained to manipulate suspects, and the many ways that effectively protecting one’s rights are counterintuitive and contrary to the social norms we are all taught – making law enforcement interactions a potential minefield for the average citizen.

Second, the session will include a comparatively brief discussion of the laws regarding psychedelic substances relating to Proposition 112 in Colorado, including the relationship between state and federal law that applies to these substances.

## [12:30 - 2 PM : "Let's Talk About Drugs", A Harm Reduction Workshop](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/505688236127/)
</button>
Due primarily to its prohibition, drug use has become more and more dangerous over the last few decades. No one knows the potency of what they're taking. No one knows if something else is in their drugs. And the adulterants and contaminants have only gotten deadlier. We really can minimize unnecessary adverse events from drug use (e.g. traumatic trips, psychotic breaks, hospitalization, death) if we just talk openly and honestly about drugs. We can make a difference.

How can you test for fentanyl contamination? Should you call 911 if your friend is unconscious? How can you minimize traumatic psychedelic experiences? Are pharmaceutical pills safer than street powders? All of these questions and more will be answered in this workshop.

<button>
## [2:30 - 4 PM : Mushroom Growing Lesson w/ Wood's Transcending Fungi](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/506832017207/)
</button>
My name is Paul Wood and I’m beyond excited for the chance to be a part of the Psychedelic Club Marketplace! Not only am I looking forward to interacting with new and old friends, but also the chance to exchange knowledge, advice, and ideas with everyone. I’m grateful for the opportunity to give a presentation about the basics of growing and genetics.

This presentation will cover basic techniques that are used for every step in the growing process, different types of genetics and what each type means, hybridization of two or more genetics, and much more!

One of my favorite aspects of mycology is how supportive the community is to each other and how each interaction is a growing experience. Please bring any questions, ideas, or topics you would like to discuss! I can’t wait to meet you and I look forward to our discussion!

<button>
## [4:30 - 6 PM : Journey w/ Rhythmic Metamorphosis](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/505716109497/)
</button>
**(Reservation only - SOLD OUT)**
Join Eva and Lisa from Rhythmic Metamorphosis for a multidimensional experience combining the elements of electronic dance music, sound healing, embodied movement, meditation, breathwork, and ceremony

Show up raw. Leave transformed and ready to integrate.
