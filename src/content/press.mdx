## Psychedelic Club in the Press

"This six-year-old nonprofit connects pro-psychedelic organizations, provides harm reduction (like free checks to ensure the purity and safety of substances), and helps boost the benefits of psychedelics" _-[Lindsey B. King, 5280, April 2022](https://www.5280.com/2022/04/magic-mushrooms-might-be-the-next-frontier-in-mental-health-care)_

"...conversations are moving forward with or without the cityâ€™s involvement. At the Psychedelic Club of Denver, members meet regularly to ask questions and share knowledge with each other about psilocybin." _-[Alexander Lekhtman, Filter, October 2021](https://filtermag.org/denver-psilocybin-decriminalize-mushrooms/)_

"The Denver club ... is not about consuming psychedelics, but rather about redefining our cultural relationship with them. Members meet regularly around Denver to listen to guest speakers and discuss topics like the corporatization of psychedelics..." _-[Robyn Griggs Lawrence, Modern Luxury, Summer 2021](http://digital.modernluxury.com/publication/?i=710951&article_id=4053592&view=articleBrowser&ver=html5)_
