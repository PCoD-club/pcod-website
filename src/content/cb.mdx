# Party Activities

<button>
## [Frick Frack Blackjack](http://www.frickfrackblackjack.com/)
</button>
Looking for a game? I bet you won't find another one quite like this one. Step right up and place a bet, but there's one catch: there's no money allowed. So what do you have? What's in your pockets?

<button>
## [Arcade Bus (Outside)](https://www.facebook.com/people/The-OC-Entertainment/100065148812667/)
</button>
Castle Bash attendees get free access to the arcade bus parked on Broadway! Just show your wristband to enter.

<button>Tarot Readings</button>
Find Cynthia in the back near the fruit fairy and liquid light show for an expert tarot reading!

<button>Fruit Fairy üçâüßö</button>
Visit our members for some free, fresh-cut fruit including oranges, watermelons, apples, etc.

<button>Playground Parachute ü™Ç</button>
Straight out of elementary school gym class! Run underneath while your friends wave the parachute, or play a game of Cat and Mouse! Smaller groups, meet by the parachute at the top of the hour so enough people are present to participate.
