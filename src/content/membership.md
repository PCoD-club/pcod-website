# [Become a Psychedelic Club of Denver member!]({membership_url})

Our newly launched membership program is a great way to give back to the club, be more involved in the community, and get even more great benefits from the club! A few of our membership perks:

- Access to a private community [Discord](https://discord.com) server
- Voting power within the organization
- Merch discounts and members-only merchandise
- Members-exclusive events and retreats
- Free access to our monthly paid events
- Volunteer opportunities

_This is your club, so if you want to see something on this list, let us know!_

## Membership Dues

While we suggest a monthly contribution of **$15/month**, we want membership to be as accessible as possible, so you can give whatever you're comfortable giving.

## Where does your money go?

- 10% Management expenses
- 10% Membership perks, voted on by PCoD members
- 20% Quarterly donations to a nonprofit, voted on by PCoD members
- 30% Harm reduction supplies, i.e. test kits, educational materials, naloxone/Narcan
- 30% Operating costs, i.e. marketing and event costs

## Ready to become a Psychedelic Club Member?

We accept two routes of becoming a member:

- Donate online to our **[GivingFuel page]({membership_url})** (preferred)
- We also accept membership dues in cash at in-person events.

Once you're a member, we'll send you an email outlining all your benefits along with an invite to our private Discord server. We'll occasionally offer members volunterr opportunities to temporarily waive their dues for a month.
